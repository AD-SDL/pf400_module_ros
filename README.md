# pf400_driver
A repository for PF400 Collaborative Robot Arm driver, including user manuals and remote control interfaces.
## PF400 Remote Client
    
Python interface that allows remote commands to be executed using simple string messages over TCP/IP on PF400 cobot.  `/pf400_client/pf400_client.py`

- PF400 is the main object that will be used for operations such as remote connection as well as sending movement commands.
- Programs are sent to the 192.168.0.1 IP address and 10x00 port numbers (first robot port number: 10100). 
- Robot data will be loaded from `/utils/robot_data.json` which contains motion profiles and joint locations.
- A program sent to robot will be executed immediately unless there is a prior operation running on the robot. 
- If a second motion command is sent while the referenced robot is moving, the second command is blocked and will not reply until the first motion is complete.

### Current features
* Robot initilazation (enable power, home robot joints, attach robot to the software and check robot state)
* Set motion profile
* Locate current location
* Stop movement
* Move to one location

## rpl_pf400 

This is a sub class of the PF400 class, which includes more specific functions that will be only in Rapid Prototyping Lab.

- This class is designed to send commands to the PF400 robot that is located in Rapid Prototyping.
- The functions are only valid in for this specific lab setup
### Current features

* Perform pick up and drop off plate operations from the OT2s, plate racks and table locations 
* Send complex programs such as transfer plate between two robots or execute full plate transfer between each robot.
* Teach/edit locations which are already exist in the robot data file. 


# Development
## Enable remote connections on PF400
- Enter IP address of the PF400 (192.168.0.1) in a web browser and then clink on Admin.
- Go to startup configuration under wizards and setup tools. Make sure that "Tcp_cmd_server" project is loaded to be automatically compiled when the run is turned on.
- Go to Control Panels and then Operator Control panel. Verify that TCP Command Server is running. 

![Control Panel TCP Server](https://github.com/AD-SDL/PF400_cobot/blob/master/resources/diagrams-figures/control-panel.png)

- To free the robot joints manualy, stop the TCP server and go to Virtual Panel and choose free all joints, click plus.

## Install

    conda create -n rpl-test python=3.8
    conda activate rpl-test

    git clone https://github.com/AD-SDL/pf400_driver.git
    cd pf400_driver
    #pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install -e . 

Better to install in develop-mode while the config is still changing

This will install arm_driver_pkg and pf400client packages

## Ros Install

## Create new configuration

## Logging

Logs go to the "running" PC `/pf400_logs/robot_client_logs.log`

## Resources

* Original documents `/resources/documents`
* Serverside VBA software `/resources/original_tcp_code`
* Backup config files `/resources/config_files`

## TODO

* move log to receive arbitrary path
* move log to receive robot_name
* move log to receive date
